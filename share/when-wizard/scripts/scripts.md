# Scripts

This directory contains the scripts used by stock plugins, especially command based condition plugins that perform particular actions: user plugin scripts will go to `~/.local/config/when-command/when-wizard/scripts`, that is the directory pointed to by the `USER_SCRIPT_FOLDER` variable. The `get_script()` function is provided to locate and retrieve scripts.
